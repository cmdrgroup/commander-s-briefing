  content: `The Commander's Passage is a 75-hour leadership transformation deployment designed for operators who refuse to settle. This is not theory. This is not motivation. This is an operational framework built for founders who build, lead, and command in the real world.

You have been selected because you demonstrate the capacity for command-level leadership. What follows is your pre-deployment briefing — the doctrines, directives, and operational standards that will govern your Passage.

CLASSIFICATION NOTICE: The material contained within this program is proprietary to CMDR Group.

    title: "This Is Not Optional Once You Start",
